# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome contributions in any form from opening and working on issues in the issue tracker to contributing to the code and documentation directly.

If you have direct repo access, please note that we develop on a fork-and-PR model - be sure to fork the repo, contribute on a branch under your own fork, then open a PR against the appropriate branch under the origin repo.
